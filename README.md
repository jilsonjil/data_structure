# Data Structures - Linked List, Sorting Algorithms, Binary Search Tree (BST)

Welcome to my **Data Structures** repository! This repository contains various experiments and implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms that I have worked on as part of my MCA (Master of Computer Applications) program.

## Projects and Experiments

This repository includes the following data structure implementations and algorithms:

### 1. **Linked List**
- **Singly Linked List**: Basic linked list implementation with operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Linked list with nodes containing references to both the next and previous nodes.
- **Circular Linked List**: A linked list where the last node points back to the first node, forming a loop.

### 2. **Sorting Algorithms**
- **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
- **Insertion Sort**: A sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
- **Quick Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot and partitions the array.
- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array and merges sorted halves.

### 3. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
- **BST Implementation**: A binary search tree with operations like insertion, searching, and deletion.
- **In-order Traversal**: Traverse the BST in ascending order.
- **Pre-order and Post-order Traversals**: Other types of traversals.
- **Height and Depth Calculation**: Operations to compute the height and depth of the tree.
